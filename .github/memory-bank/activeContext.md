# Active Context: POC Implementation Phase

## Current Focus

Building the foundational shared infrastructure for Lambda deployments. This is a Proof of Concept (POC) to validate the approach before adding complexity.

## Current Sprint Goals

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Deploy VPC, API Gateway, IAM roles, S3 buckets
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automated infrastructure deployment workflow
3. **Terraform Outputs**: Well-defined outputs for Lambda team consumption
4. **Documentation**: Clear integration guide for Lambda teams

## Recent Decisions

- **Simplified Scope**: POC only - no environments, no complex features
- **Infrastructure Only**: No Lambda functions in this repository
- **GitHub OIDC**: Use GitHub Actions with OIDC for secure deployments
- **Single Region**: Start with us-east-1 for simplicity
- **Cost-Optimized**: Single NAT Gateway, minimal resources

## Active Work Items

### In Progress

- Setting up memory bank documentation
- Creating core Terraform infrastructure files
- Building GitHub Actions workflow
- Writing integration documentation

### Next Steps

1. Create main.tf with core AWS resources
2. Define variables.tf for configuration
3. Set up outputs.tf for Lambda team consumption
4. Create GitHub Actions deployment workflow
5. Write Lambda integration documentation
6. Test end-to-end deployment

## Current Challenges

- **State Management**: Need to set up S3 backend for Terraform state
- **GitHub OIDC**: Configure AWS identity provider for GitHub Actions
- **Resource Naming**: Establish consistent naming conventions
- **Output Design**: Ensure outputs meet Lambda team needs

## Key Decisions Pending

- **AWS Region**: Confirm us-east-1 or choose different region
- **State Bucket**: Where to store Terraform state
- **VPC CIDR**: Default CIDR range for the shared VPC
- **Availability Zones**: How many AZs to use

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Infrastructure deploys successfully
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow works
- [ ] Outputs are accessible via remote state
- [ ] Documentation is clear and actionable
- [ ] POC can be demonstrated to stakeholders

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: GitHub OIDC setup complexity
  **Mitigation**: Use well-documented patterns, test thoroughly
- **Risk**: Terraform state conflicts
  **Mitigation**: Use S3 backend with DynamoDB locking
- **Risk**: AWS service limits
  **Mitigation**: Stay within default limits for POC

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Core infrastructure and GitHub Actions
- **Week 2**: Documentation and testing
- **Week 3**: Demo and feedback collection
- **Week 4**: Plan next iteration based on feedback
